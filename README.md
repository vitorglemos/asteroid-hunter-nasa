# Asteroids Measurements & Discoveries by V. Lemos
Last update: 2023-03-31

## Introduction 
This project was created for the purpose of organizing and listing data on new asteroid discoveries made by me in international NASA/IASC campaigns. All information provided here is public and can be found on the official **Minot Planet Center** and **NASA Database**. Access links to such data can be found below.

**Minot Planet Center**: The Minor Planet Center (MPC) is the official body for observing and reporting on minor planets under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Founded in 1947, it operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Oficial website: https://minorplanetcenter.net/ 

**Nasa Objects Database**: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the US federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research. Oficial website to objects database, such as asteroids and coments: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/

**IASC/NASA**: The International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) is a citizen science program that provides high-quality astronomical data to citizen scientists around the world. These citizen scientists are able to make original astronomical discoveries and participate in hands-on astronomy.  Oficial website: http://iasc.cosmosearch.org/

## Asteroid Classifications
- **Main Asteroid Belt**: The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, generally with not very elongated orbits. 
- **Trojans**: These asteroids share an orbit with a larger planet, but do not collide with it because they gather around two special places in the orbit.
- **Near-Earth Asteroids (NEO)**: These objects have orbits that pass close by that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known as Earth-crossers.

**ObserverDesignation**: Provisional designation informed by the observatory.

**Orbit**: Classification of the asteroid based on the Minor Planet Center. 

**Designation**: Provisional designation made available by NASA/Minor Planet Center (it is possible to query more data about the asteroid using the designation code).

**IsNEO**: 
- 0 When the asteroid is not Near-Earth Asteroids. 
- 1 When the asteroid is a Near-Earth Asteroids.

**Contribution Type**:
- Pending: These are detections that appear to be valid detections but have not been fully verified by the Minor Planet Center yet.
- Orbit Updated: When there is an asteroid it is already in the Minor Planet Center database and the new detection data is used to add information about the object's orbit.
- Provisional: Provisional detections are recognized as asteroid discoveries and must now undergo further observations over a three to five year period in order to verify the asteroid's orbit and consolidate any additional measurements of the object.
