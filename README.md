# Asteroids Measurements & Discoveries by V. Lemos

## Introduction 
This project was created for the purpose of organizing and listing data on new asteroid discoveries made by me in international NASA/IASC campaigns. All information provided here is public and can be found on the official **Minot Planet Center** and **NASA Database**. Access links to such data can be found below.

**Minot Planet Center**: The Minor Planet Center (MPC) is the official body for observing and reporting on minor planets under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Founded in 1947, it operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Oficial website: https://minorplanetcenter.net/ 

**Nasa Objects Database**: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the US federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research. Oficial website to objects database, such as asteroids and coments: https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/

**IASC/NASA**: The International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) is a citizen science program that provides high-quality astronomical data to citizen scientists around the world. These citizen scientists are able to make original astronomical discoveries and participate in hands-on astronomy.  Oficial website: http://iasc.cosmosearch.org/
